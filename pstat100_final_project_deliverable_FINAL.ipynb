    "Student success in school can often lead to success in the real world and vice versa. Being able to predict a students success and even influencing them in a positive way would lead to a general increase in grades and overall wellbeing of students. In order to go about this goal we must first find the factors that have the biggest impact on a students performance in school. Once we are able to distinguish which factors have the greatest influence on student grades, we can predict whether a student will pass or fail the class. After conducting analysis on our dataset, we found that the number of previous class failures and gender were the biggest factors in predicting whether a student will pass or fail a given class.  To support these findings, we estimated the differences in means between these variables and overall grade, and found that only previous failures and gender led to a statistically significant difference in whether the student passes or fails a class."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project uses the [Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to explore the relationships between academic achievement and student demographic information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1a) Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Student Performance dataset that we chose contains information on secondary education students from two different schools in Portugual. It primarily consists of information pertaining to class grades, alongside demographic and personal information for each student. Additionally, our data was collected through school reports and questionnaires, with some variables being coded on specific scales (such as 1-5 for \"very bad\" to \"excellent\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Student achievenment and education is a very important aspect of our society; if students are unable to effectively learn and be succesful in school, they will likely experience many difficulties transitioning to the real world when they grow up. Through analyzing this dataset we can learn which factors make the biggest impact on student grades. Thus, these findings can help us predict student success in the future and create an overall better system or environment for students to achieve at a higher level. Although student achievement can be attributed to past grades, there is also a large chance that other outside variables are having an affect as well. With the analysis of this data we hope to provide a clear picture of what factors are hurting students and which ones are helping students in their academic achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b) Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary aim is to explore what factors have the greatest impact (both positive and negative) on a given student's academic grades. Additionally, we will analyze these factors to see if they have a significant impact on predicting whether a given student will pass or fail a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To approach our questions, we will begin by visualizing the variables in our dataset and identifying which ones are most correlated to a student's overall grade. Next, we will plot these variables against student grades and separate plots by different variables (such as gender or overall health), in order to identify any patterns or interesting relationships in the data. Finally, we will use a model to estimate whether these factors actually have a significant impact on whether or not a student passes or fails a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis we chose the variables `age`,`sex`,`health`, and `failures` as predictors for `overall_grade`. After creating exploratory plots, the data pointed to age, sex, and health having a lower impact on difference in overall grade, while number of past failures had a larger impact. This indication was partially supported by the linear model that we constructed. Through the model, we found that `age` and `health` had little impact on whether a student passed or failed a class (`overall_grade`) while `failures` and `sex` had a significant impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main questions we aimed to answer in this project are as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   **1. What features have the greatest impact on student grades?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **2. Does the data suggest that these features have a significant impact on predicting whether a student will pass or fail?**"

    " There are numerous variables that can affect a students academic performance. However, in analyzing our dataset we have found that the most positive correlation comes mainly from previous good grades. With slightly less correlation are the study time, and parents level of education. Good study habits are seemingly passed down from a students parents which leads to higher grades. Contrarily, the factor with the most negative correlation on overall grades was travel time from home to school. Travel time could have such an effect as it forces the students to physically have less time for school work or studying. Additionally, alcohol consumption was the next leading negative correlation to student grades. However, this comes as no surprise, alcohol consumption is well known for having an inverse relationship with student success. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Overall, these several variables of a students life and choices do seem to be a good indicator of whether they will pass or fail in school. Thus, Students with more negative factors in their life tend to have more failures, and students with more positive factors tend to have no failures. However, these factors do not always determine a students success, there are some outlier students who pass all their classes while dealing with more negative variables, likewise there are students who still struggle when they displayed more positive variables. Furthermore, if time had allowed, it would have been beneficial to be able to delve deeper into our dataset and further our findings. Such as, adding other factors to deepen our analysis, or looking at a different main objective other than just grades or pass/fail.
